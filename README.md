# JWT Authentication System

This project is a simple **JWT-based authentication system** built from scratch using **React**, **Node.js**, and **MySQL**. The application allows users to sign up, log in, and access a protected dashboard. It demonstrates secure authentication using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** and routing with **React Router DOM**.
